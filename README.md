# My_projects

Maybe something in this repo is just nothing but a joke.
This repo is created to store some small projects and simple but significant codes for me at that time.
I'd like to regard this repo as the growing path of my own.

Learning programming, learning math and learning how to solve problems in the real world.
I learned this cuz want to help the world be a better place using my intelligence and hardwork.
